----Answers:
1) Forces cannot be seen directly, but their effects can be observed. 
We know they are there because they cause changes in the motion or shape of objects. 
For example, if you push a table, it will move. The tables movement is evidence of the applied force.
2) The units of force vary depending on the system of measurement. In the International System of Units (SI), the unit of force is the newton (N). Other commonly used units include pounds (lb) and dynes (dyn). To measure force, you would typically use a device called a force meter or force gauge.
3)Forces can make objects accelerate, decelerate, change direction, or deform. For example, a force can accelerate a car, make a ball stop rolling, change the direction of a moving object, or compress a spring. Forces also play a role in causing objects to break or bend, depending on the magnitude and direction of the force applied.
4) Balanced forces produce a state of equilibrium where the net force acting on an object is zero. This means that the object will remain at rest or move at a constant velocity. Unbalanced forces, on the other hand, result in a change in motion, causing acceleration or deceleration.
5) Air resistance, also known as drag, is the force exerted by air molecules on objects moving through the air. It opposes the motion of the object. The best shape for avoiding air resistance depends on the specific situation. In general, streamlined or aerodynamic shapes reduce air resistance. For example, a teardrop shape is often used in designing vehicles, bicycles, and other objects that need to minimize air resistance.
6) Good points of friction include providing traction to prevent slipping, allowing us to walk, and enabling us to grip objects. Friction also allows brakes to stop vehicles and helps in writing using a pen or pencil. However, friction also has some drawbacks. It can cause wear and tear on objects, leading to degradation or damage. Friction also opposes the motion of objects, which can make it more difficult to move them.
7) Pressure is the force applied per unit area. It is defined as the ratio between the force acting perpendicular to the surface and the area over which it is distributed. The formula for calculating pressure is P = F/A, where P represents pressure, F represents the force applied, and A represents the area over which the force is distributed. Pressure is typically measured in units such as pascals (Pa), pounds per square inch (psi), or atmospheres (atm)
8)An elephant can walk on dodgy sand due to its large and spread-out weight distribution, which reduces the pressure exerted per unit area. The massive size and wide feet of an elephant distribute its weight over a larger surface area, reducing the pressure on the sand and preventing sinking. In contrast, a car has a smaller weight distribution area relative to its total weight, resulting in higher pressure per unit area. This increased pressure causes the car to sink into the sand. The elephants weight distribution and surface area prevent it from sinking as easily.
9) Instantaneous speed refers to the speed of an object at a specific moment in time. It is determined by calculating the distance traveled in a very small time interval. On the other hand, average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. It gives an overall measure of how fast an object is moving over a certain period.

10) The weight of 2kg of sugar would be 2kg multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity. On Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.8 m/s², so the weight of 2kg of sugar would be 19.6 Newtons (N).

11) a) On Earth, the weight of a 100g apple would be 100g multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²). Therefore, the weight of the apple would be approximately 0.98 N.
   b) On the Moon, the acceleration due to gravity is about 1/6th of that on Earth, so the weight of the apple would be approximately 0.16 N.

12) It is difficult to walk on ice because ice has a low coefficient of friction. The low friction between the ice and the soles of our shoes makes it challenging to generate enough traction to walk without slipping. This is due to the thin layer of water that forms on the surface of ice when pressure is applied, reducing the friction further.

13) A rocket moves in outer space by using Newton's third law of motion, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The rocket expels high-speed gases (propellant) out of its engines in one direction, creating a force in the opposite direction. This force propels the rocket forward according to Newton's third law, allowing it to move even in the absence of air or any other medium.

14) When a partly inflated balloon is released, it flies around as it deflates due to the principle of conservation of momentum. As the air escapes from the balloon, it pushes against the surrounding air in one direction, causing the balloon to move in the opposite direction. This movement is a result of the change in momentum, as the escaping air exerts a force on the balloon.

15) The two interaction pairs of forces when a book is placed on a table are:
   a) The weight of the book acting downward due to gravity, and the normal force exerted by the table acting upward to support the weight of the book.
   b) The force applied by the book on the table due to its weight, and the equal and opposite force applied by the table on the book.

16) In this collision scenario, the law of conservation of momentum applies. Since both objects stop after the collision, their total momentum before the collision must be equal to zero. The momentum of the toy car can be calculated by multiplying its mass (0.5 kg) by its initial speed (4 m/s). Since the total momentum is zero after the collision, we can use this information to find the speed of the truck.

17) The momentum of a ball can be calculated by multiplying its mass (2 kg) by its velocity (5 m/s). Therefore, the momentum of the ball would be 10 kg·m/s.

18) The gain in momentum of an object can be calculated by multiplying the force applied to it by the time for which the force is applied. In this case, a force of 50 N acts on the object for 12 seconds. Therefore, the gain in momentum would be 50 N multiplied by 12 seconds, resulting in a gain of 600 N·s (Newton-seconds) or kg·m/s (kilogram-meter per second).
